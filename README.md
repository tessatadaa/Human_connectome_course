# Human_connectome_course

**Hi everybody!**

My name is _Tessa_ and I'm studying psychology at [University of Helsinki](https://www.helsinki.fi "University's homepage").

In this course I'd like to learn:
1. To use different tools to analyse data
2. What are the pros of different style analysis
3. ...and also what are the cons.
4. How to interpret the results properly

That's all for now!
